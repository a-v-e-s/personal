need a new backup plan for database, as tar works differently than i thought it did.
tarchiver.sh will not work as I hoped.

Data visualization!!
statistical relationships and such!
relationships between:

    any given column and the probability of burnout @ + range(-14, 15) days
        apply to whole range of values possible:
            probability of burnout @ range(-10, 11) days for range(0, 13) project/work/cardio/social/sleep/vice hours

    any given column and the probability of > range(4, 11) hours of work @ + range(-14, 15) days
        apply to whole range of values possible:
            probability of burnout @ range(-14, 15) days for range(0, 13) project/work/cardio/social/sleep/vice hours

    trendlines for each column over time (daily, weekly, monthly, and annually)

    any given column and its correlation to any other column

    graphs of variance and variance over time of any given column

    ```
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.add_axes([<left>,<bottom>,<width>,<height>])
    # stuff
    ax.plot(x,y)
    ax.legend(*args)
    ax.set_title(*args)
    ax.set_xlabel(*args)
    ax.set_ylabel(*args)
    # ...
    plt.show()
    ```

test and debug on next weekly entry; it will probably have several problems.
Will test daily, weekly, and monthly insert statements
Commit and merge with master if successful.

Figure out how to upload git repo to github WITHOUT statements.py
All the really private material has been moved to there.
